Aggressive Communication and Assertive Communication are two different styles of expressing one's thoughts, needs, and feelings. Here's how they differ:

>>> 1. Aggressive Communication:
   - Tone and Language: Often loud, hostile, and confrontational. The speaker may use insults, threats, or sarcasm.
   - Body Language: May involve pointing fingers, invading personal space, or making aggressive gestures.
   - Goal: The goal is to dominate, control, or intimidate others to get what they want.
   - Effect on Others: Causes resentment, fear, or a defensive reaction. It can damage relationships and create hostility.
   - Examples:
     - “You’d better do it now, or else.”
     - “You’re always wrong, and I’m right.”

>>> 2. Assertive Communication:
   - Tone and Language: Firm but calm. The speaker clearly expresses their needs, opinions, or feelings without belittling or blaming others.
   - Body Language: Relaxed posture, maintaining eye contact without being intimidating.
   - Goal: The goal is to communicate in a respectful and clear way that fosters understanding and collaboration.
   - Effect on Others: Builds mutual respect, strengthens relationships, and encourages open, honest dialogue.
   - Examples:
     - “I feel frustrated when you interrupt me. I’d appreciate it if you let me finish my point.”
     - “I respect your opinion, but I have a different perspective.”

>>> Key Differences:
- Aggression seeks to overpower; assertiveness seeks to balance needs.
- Aggressive communicators disregard others’ rights; assertive communicators respect both their own and others' rights.
