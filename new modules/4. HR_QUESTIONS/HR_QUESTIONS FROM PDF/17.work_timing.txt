Yes, I am open to extending my work timings and working over weekends when necessary. I understand that certain projects or tasks may require extra time and effort to meet deadlines or address urgent issues. As a dedicated team member, I am committed to contributing effectively to the success of the projects and meeting the needs of the organization. Flexibility with work hours and weekends is something I am willing to accommodate to ensure that tasks are completed efficiently and effectively.
