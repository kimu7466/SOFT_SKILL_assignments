22). What was the biggest failure you had to face?
""
One of the biggest failures I've faced was during a project where I underestimated the time needed to complete a critical task. As a result, we missed an important deadline, causing inconvenience to our team and delaying the project. However, I took ownership of the mistake and immediately began analyzing what went wrong. I realized that I hadn't effectively prioritized tasks and hadn't communicated with my team about potential challenges.

From this experience, I learned the importance of thorough planning and clear communication. I implemented better time management strategies, such as breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and regularly updating my team on progress and any obstacles. This failure taught me valuable lessons about accountability, teamwork, and adaptability, which have since helped me successfully navigate similar challenges in future projects.
