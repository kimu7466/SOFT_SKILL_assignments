13). What makes you angry?
""
I don't get angry more often. 
because there is no point in getting angry, if that ruins your mood even more, so I choose to avoid anger.

but if I have no choice but to answer this question, I would say that if a person gives me his word. and doesn't act accordingly, that affects me, but still anger is not going to help anyway so I choose to avoid anger with a lesson learned witch is that person is not a man of his word. so I will be aware before giving him any responsibility again.
