11). If given a choice would you like to work in a team or standalone?


""
"I believe that both working in a team and standalone have their own merits, and my preference depends on the specific context and requirements of the task or project at hand. In a team environment, I appreciate the opportunity for collaboration, brainstorming ideas, and leveraging the diverse expertise of team members to achieve common goals. I thrive in environments where there's open communication, mutual respect, and a shared commitment to success. On the other hand, working standalone allows me to exercise autonomy, take ownership of my work, and demonstrate self-reliance and initiative. I'm comfortable working independently and can effectively manage my time and resources to meet deadlines and deliver quality outcomes. Ultimately, I'm adaptable and flexible, and I'm confident in my ability to excel in both team-based and solitary work settings, depending on what the situation calls for."
